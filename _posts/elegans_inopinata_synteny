Synteny between _C. elegans_ and _C. inopinata_

Workflow:

- use blastp to find mutual best matches betweeen C. elegans and C. inopinata proteins
- find the genomic locations of the coding regions from both species from their genome annotation files
- plot the normalized position of each protein whose genes are on the same chromosome in both species
